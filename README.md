# Atlassian 3-legged OAuth Example in Ruby/Sinatra

Customised from https://bitbucket.org/atlassian_tutorial/atlassian-oauth-examples

Displays an OAuth access token and secret after OAuth authentication, which can then be used as a
long-lived access token in another app's authentication, for instance.

  `bundle`

  `rackup`

You can now access the app through:

    http://localhost:9292
